1,1,"धृतराष्ट्र उवाच | धर्मक्षेत्रे कुरुक्षेत्रे समवेता युयुत्सवः | मामकाः पाण्डवाश्चैव किमकुर्वत सञ्जय ||१-१||","dhṛitarāśhtṛa uvācha dharma-kṣhetre kuru-kṣhetre samavetā yuyutsavaḥ māmakāḥ pāṇḍavāśhchaiva kimakurvata sañjaya","Dhritarashtra said: O Sanjaya, what did my sons and the sons of Pandu do when they assembled on the holy field of Kurukshetra, eager for battle?","Before important events (like a major project launch, a difficult conversation, or starting a new venture), pause and reflect on your motivations, the potential outcomes, and the ethical considerations involved. Understanding the 'why' behind your intended actions helps clarify choices and anticipate consequences, just as Dhritarashtra sought to understand the situation unfolding on the 'field of duty'."
1,2,"सञ्जय उवाच | दृष्ट्वा तु पाण्डवानीकं व्यूढं दुर्योधनस्तदा | आचार्यमुपसङ्गम्य राजा वचनमब्रवीत् ||१-२||","sañjaya uvācha dṛiṣhṭvā tu pāṇḍavānīkaṁ vyūḍhaṁ duryodhanastadā āchāryamupasaṅgamya rājā vachanamabravīt","Sanjaya said: Seeing the army of the Pandavas arrayed for battle, King Duryodhana approached his teacher Drona and spoke these words.","When facing complex challenges or critical decisions (e.g., career changes, major investments, ethical dilemmas), don't rely solely on your own perspective, especially if feeling pressured. Actively seek counsel from experienced mentors, teachers, or trusted advisors. Their wisdom can offer valuable insights, strategic alternatives, and help avoid potential pitfalls born from a biased or limited viewpoint, just as Duryodhana instinctively turned to his teacher Drona."
2,14,"मात्रास्पर्शास्तु कौन्तेय शीतोष्णसुखदुःखदाः | आगमापायिनोऽनित्यास्तांस्तितिक्षस्व भारत ||२-१४||","mātrā-sparśhās tu kaunteya śhītoṣhṇa-sukha-duḥkha-dāḥ āgamāpāyino ’nityās tānstitikṣhasva bhārata","O son of Kunti, the contact between the senses and the sense objects gives rise to fleeting perceptions of happiness and distress. These are non-permanent, and come and go like the winter and summer seasons. O descendent of Bharat, one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed.","Cultivate emotional resilience by recognizing that life's ups and downs (e.g., exam stress, project deadlines, job insecurity, fluctuating relationships, fleeting praise or criticism) are temporary, like changing seasons. Practice accepting discomfort ('titiksha') without being mentally overwhelmed. Focus on your stable inner self and long-term goals, rather than being excessively swayed by transient sensory experiences of pleasure or pain. This builds inner strength."
2,41,"व्यवसायात्मिका बुद्धिरेकेह कुरुनन्दन | बहुशाखा ह्यनन्ताश्च बुद्धयोऽव्यवसायिनाम् ||२-४१||","vyavasāyātmikā buddhir ekeha kuru-nandana bahu-śhākhā hy anantāśh cha buddhayo ’vyavasāyinām","Those who are resolute have a single-pointed focus, O Arjuna. The thoughts of the irresolute are endless and branch in all directions.","Prioritize single-pointed focus ('ekehā') in your key endeavors, whether mastering a skill, pursuing a career path, completing studies, or working on a specific project. Avoid scattering your mental energy ('bahu-śhākhā') through excessive multitasking or constantly shifting goals without completion. A resolute mind, fixed on a clear, well-defined objective, achieves far more effectively and efficiently than an irresolute one pulled in countless directions."
2,47,"कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन | मा कर्मफलहेतुर्भूर्मा ते सङ्गोऽस्त्वकर्मणि ||२-४७||","karmaṇy-evādhikāras te mā phaleṣhu kadāchana mā karma-phala-hetur bhūr mā te saṅgo 'stv akarmaṇi","You have a right to perform your prescribed duties, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions. Never consider yourself to be the cause of the results of your activities, and never be attached to inaction.","Dedicate yourself fully to performing your responsibilities (at work, in studies, within family, personal growth) to the best of your ability ('adhikāras te karmaṇi'), but consciously relinquish attachment to the specific outcomes or rewards ('mā phaleṣhu kadāchana'). Focus on the quality, integrity, and effort of your actions. This mindset reduces performance anxiety, fosters excellence regardless of external validation, prevents discouragement from setbacks, and avoids the trap of inaction ('sango 'stu akarmaṇi') born from fear of failure."
2,48,"योगस्थः कुरु कर्माणि सङ्गं त्यक्त्वा धनञ्जय | सिद्ध्यसिद्ध्योः समो भूत्वा समत्वं योग उच्यते ||२-४८||","yoga-sthaḥ kuru karmāṇi saṅgaṁ tyaktvā dhanañjaya siddhy-asiddhyoḥ samo bhūtvā samatvaṁ yoga uchyate","Perform your duty equipoised, O Arjuna, abandoning all attachment to success or failure. Such equanimity is called yoga.","Strive for emotional equanimity ('samatvam') while performing your actions ('kuru karmāṇi'). Whether facing success ('siddhi') or failure ('asiddhi'), praise or criticism, gain or loss, remain internally balanced and centered ('samo bhūtvā'), having abandoned attachment ('saṅgaṁ tyaktvā'). This mental poise ('yoga') allows for clearer thinking, better decision-making unbiased by emotional reactions, and fosters lasting inner peace regardless of external circumstances."
2,50,"बुद्धियुक्तो जहातीह उभे सुकृतदुष्कृते | तस्माद्योगाय युज्यस्व योगः कर्मसु कौशलम् ||२-५०||","buddhi-yukto jahātīha ubhe sukṛita-duṣhkṛite tasmād yogāya yujyasva yogaḥ karmasu kauśhalam","One who is wise lets go of all results of good and bad actions. Thus, focus on yoga (skillful living), for yoga is the art of working with excellence.","True skill in action ('yogah karmasu kauśhalam') involves executing your tasks with intelligence and excellence ('buddhi-yukto'), free from attachment to the results, whether deemed 'good' ('sukṛita') or 'bad' ('duṣhkṛite'). Focus on refining your craft, whether in your profession, studies, or personal projects, acting skillfully and ethically without being driven by ego or the anxiety of outcomes. This ""skillful living"" transcends the duality of success and failure."
3,19,"तस्मादसक्तः सततं कार्यं कर्म समाचर | असक्तो ह्याचरन्कर्म परमाप्नोति पूरुषः ||३-१९||","tasmād asaktaḥ satataṁ kāryaṁ karma samāchara asakto hy ācharan karma param āpnoti pūruṣhaḥ","Therefore, perform your duties without attachment, remaining steadfast in yoga. By working without attachment, one attains the Supreme.","Engage consistently ('satatam') and diligently in your required duties ('kāryaṁ karma samāchara') without being attached ('asaktaḥ') to personal gain, recognition, or specific results. Acting selflessly and steadily, simply because it is the right thing to do ('kāryam'), purifies the mind and aligns you with higher principles or your true nature ('param āpnoti'), leading ultimately to inner fulfillment and excellence."
4,8,"परित्राणाय साधूनां विनाशाय च दुष्कृताम् | धर्मसंस्थापनार्थाय सम्भवामि युगे युगे ||४-८||","paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśhāya cha duṣhkṛitām dharma-sansthāpanārthāya sambhavāmi yuge yuge","To protect the righteous, to annihilate the wicked, and to reestablish the principles of dharma I appear millennium after millennium.","Be inspired to actively uphold righteousness ('dharma') in your own sphere of influence. Stand up for ethical principles, support and protect the vulnerable or those acting virtuously ('sādhūnām'), and challenge wrongdoing or unethical practices ('duṣkṛitām') when you encounter them (e.g., in the workplace, community, or personal interactions). Understand that maintaining moral order ('dharma-sansthāpanārthāya') requires conscious effort, courage, and active participation."
5,23,"शक्नोतीहैव यः सोढुं प्राक्शरीरविमोक्षणात् | कामक्रोधोद्भवं वेगं स युक्तः स सुखी नरः ||५-२३||","śhaknotīhaiva yaḥ soḍhuṁ prāk śharīra-vimokṣhaṇāt kāma-krodhodbhavaṁ vegaṁ sa yuktaḥ sa sukhī naraḥ","One who can withstand the urges of lust and anger before death is a true yogi and is happy.","Recognize the powerful impulses ('vegam') arising from desire ('kāma') and anger ('krodha'). True strength, inner peace ('sa sukhi narah'), and stability ('sa yuktah') come from developing the capacity to withstand ('soḍhuṁ') these urges *before* they overpower your judgment and actions, even while living ('ihaiva...prāk śharīra-vimokṣhaṇāt'). Practice self-control in daily life (e.g., managing impulsive reactions, resisting instant gratification, handling frustration constructively) to build this inner resilience."
6,5,"उद्धरेदात्मनात्मानं नात्मानमवसादयेत् | आत्मैव ह्यात्मनो बन्धुरात्मैव रिपुरात्मनः ||६-५||","uddhared ātmanātmānaṁ nātmānam avasādayet ātmaiva hy ātmano bandhur ātmaiva ripur ātmanaḥ","Elevate yourself by your own mind; do not degrade yourself. The mind is both friend and enemy.","Take conscious responsibility for your own upliftment ('uddhared ātmanātmānam') through the power of your own mind and efforts. Do not let your mind drag you down ('nātmānam avasādayet'). Your mind can be your greatest ally ('bandhu'), fostering growth, focus, and resilience when disciplined and positive. Conversely, an uncontrolled mind filled with negativity, doubt, and distraction becomes your greatest obstacle ('ripu'). Actively cultivate self-awareness and mental discipline to make your mind your friend."
6,17,"युक्ताहारविहारस्य युक्तचेष्टस्य कर्मसु | युक्तस्वप्नावबोधस्य योगो भवति दुःखहा ||६-१७||","yuktāhāra-vihārasya yukta-cheṣhṭasya karmasu yukta-svapnāvabodhasya yogo bhavati duḥkha-hā","One who is regulated in diet, recreation, work, sleep, and wakefulness attains yoga, which destroys all sorrow.","Cultivate moderation and balance ('yukta') in all aspects of daily life: eating habits ('āhāra'), recreation and movement ('vihāra'), effort in work ('cheṣṭasya karmasu'), and sleep/wake cycles ('svapnāvabodhasya'). Extremes in any area disrupt inner equilibrium and hinder mental clarity and peace ('yoga'). A regulated, balanced lifestyle is the foundation for well-being, resilience, and effectively managing life's stresses ('duḥkha-hā' - destroying sorrow)."
12,13,"अद्वेष्टा सर्वभूतानां मैत्रः करुण एव च | निर्ममो निरहङ्कारः समदुःखसुखः क्षमी ||१२-१३||","adveṣhṭā sarva-bhūtānāṁ maitraḥ karuṇa eva cha nirmamo nirahankāraḥ sama-duḥkha-sukhaḥ kṣhamī","One who is not envious but is a kind friend to all living entities, who does not think himself a proprietor and is free from false ego, who is equal in both happiness and distress, who is forgiving...","Actively cultivate these qualities in your daily interactions and inner attitude: Be non-envious and genuinely happy for others ('adveṣṭā'), cultivate universal friendliness ('maitraḥ') and compassion ('karuṇaḥ') towards all beings. Practice letting go of possessiveness ('nirmamaḥ') and false ego ('nirahankāraḥ'). Strive for emotional balance, remaining equipoised in joy and sorrow ('sama-duḥkha-sukhaḥ'), and develop a forgiving nature ('kṣhamī'). These virtues foster harmony and inner peace."
12,16,"अनपेक्षः शुचिर्दक्ष उदासीनो गतव्यथः | सर्वारम्भपरित्यागी यो मद्भक्तः स मे प्रियः ||१२-१६||","anapekṣhaḥ śhuchir dakṣha udāsīno gata-vyathaḥ sarvārambha-parityāgī yo mad-bhaktaḥ sa me priyaḥ","My devotee who is free from expectations, pure, skilled, impartial, untroubled, and renounces all undertakings is dear to Me.","Strive to embody these qualities: Be free from dependence on external outcomes or expectations ('anapekṣhaḥ'), maintain inner and outer purity ('śhuchiḥ'), be skillful and efficient in your actions ('dakṣhaḥ'), remain impartial and objective ('udāsīnaḥ'), stay untroubled and free from mental anguish ('gata-vyathaḥ'), and renounce the egoistic attachment behind initiating actions purely for personal gain ('sarvārambha-parityāgī'). These foster inner freedom and purposeful action."
18,26,"मुक्तसङ्गोऽनहंवादी धृत्युत्साहसमन्वितः | सिद्ध्यसिद्ध्योर्निर्विकारः कर्ता सात्त्विक उच्यते ||१८-२६||","mukta-saṅgo ’nahaṁvādī dhṛity-utsāha-samanvitaḥ siddhy-asiddhyor nirvikāraḥ kartā sāttvika uchyate","A doer who is free from attachment, non-egotistic, endowed with resolve and enthusiasm, and unaffected by success or failure is said to be sattvic (pure).","Embody the qualities of a 'Sattvic' (acting from clarity and goodness) doer in your work and life: Perform actions with determination ('dhṛiti') and enthusiasm ('utsāha'), but remain free from attachment ('mukta-saṅgaḥ') and egoism ('anahaṁvādī' - not boasting ""I did this""). Crucially, stay unaffected and maintain composure whether the outcome is success or failure ('siddhy-asiddhyor nirvikāraḥ'). This approach ensures clarity, resilience, ethical conduct, and sustained effort."
18,78,"यत्र योगेश्वरः कृष्णो यत्र पार्थो धनुर्धरः | तत्र श्रीर्विजयो भूतिर्ध्रुवा नीतिर्मतिर्मम ||१८-७८||","yatra yogeśhvaraḥ kṛiṣhṇo yatra pārtho dhanurdharaḥ tatra śhrīr vijayo bhūtir dhruvā nītir matir mama","Wherever there is Krishna, the master of all mystics, and wherever there is Arjuna, the supreme archer, there will also certainly be opulence, victory, extraordinary power, and morality. That is my opinion.","Recognize that true success, prosperity ('śrīḥ'), victory ('vijayaḥ'), well-being ('bhūtiḥ'), and sound policy ('dhruvā nītiḥ') emerge when divine wisdom, guidance, and purpose (represented by Krishna, the 'Yogeśhvara') are combined with skillful, courageous, and dedicated action (represented by Arjuna, the 'Dhanurdhara'). In your own life and work, strive to align your actions with ethical principles and wise counsel, ensuring that your efforts are both well-intentioned and effectively executed."
3,37,"काम एष क्रोध एष रजोगुणसमुद्भवः | महाशनो महापाप्मा विद्ध्येनमिह वैरिणम् ||३-३७||","kāma eṣha krodha eṣha rajo-guṇa-samudbhavaḥ mahāśhano mahā-pāpmā viddhyenam iha vairiṇam","It is lust alone, which is born of contact with the mode of passion, and later transformed into anger. Know this as the sinful, all-devouring enemy in the world.","Be vigilant against the internal enemies: intense, selfish desire ('kāma') and anger ('krodha'), which arise from the activating, turbulent quality of nature ('rajo-guṇa'). Understand that unchecked desire often leads to frustration and anger when thwarted. Recognize these powerful, insatiable ('mahāśhanaḥ'), and destructive ('mahāpāpmā') emotions as primary obstacles ('vairiṇam') to peace, clarity, and ethical conduct. Self-awareness is the first step to managing them."
9,22,"अनन्याश्चिन्तयन्तो मां ये जनाः पर्युपासते | तेषां नित्याभियुक्तानां योगक्षेमं वहाम्यहम् ||९-२२||","ananyāśh chintayanto māṁ ye janāḥ paryupāsate teṣhāṁ nityābhiyuktānāṁ yoga-kṣhemaṁ vahāmyaham","To those who worship Me with devotion, meditating on Me alone, I provide for all their needs and secure what they lack.","When you wholeheartedly dedicate your thoughts and actions ('ananyāś cintayanto') to a higher purpose, ethical principle, or spiritual goal ('mām'), cultivating unwavering focus and constant engagement ('nityābhiyuktānām'), trust that your essential needs ('kṣhemam' - security, well-being) will be met and your progress ('yogam' - acquisition of what is lacking) will be facilitated ('vahāmyaham'). This implies focusing fully on your duty and devotion, allowing the universal order or divine grace to support your journey."
10,20,"अहमात्मा गुडाकेश सर्वभूताशयस्थितः | अहमादिश्च मध्यं च भूतानामन्त एव च ||१०-२०||","aham ātmā guḍākeśha sarva-bhūtāśhaya-sthitaḥ aham ādiśh cha madhyaṁ cha bhūtānām anta eva cha","I am the Self, O Arjuna, seated in the hearts of all creatures. I am the beginning, the middle, and the end of all beings.","Cultivate the awareness that the same divine essence or Self ('Ātmā') resides within the hearts ('sarva-bhūtāśhaya-sthitaḥ') of all living beings, including yourself. Recognize this universal presence as the source ('ādi'), sustainer ('madhyam'), and ultimate dissolution point ('anta') of all existence. This perspective fosters deep reverence, empathy, and a sense of interconnectedness with all life, transforming how you relate to others and the world, dissolving alienation and prejudice."
13,8,"अमानित्वमदम्भित्वमहिंसा क्षान्तिरार्जवम् | आचार्योपासनं शौचं स्थैर्यमात्मविनिग्रहः ||१३-८||","amānitvam adambhitvam ahinsā kṣhāntir ārjavam āchāryopāsanaṁ śhauchaṁ sthairyam ātma-vinigrahaḥ","Humility, unpretentiousness, non-violence, forgiveness, uprightness, service to the teacher, purity, steadfastness, self-control.","Understand that virtues like humility ('amānitvam'), lack of pretense ('adambhitvam'), non-violence ('ahimsā'), forgiveness ('kṣhāntiḥ'), uprightness ('ārjavam'), respect for teachers ('āchāryopāsanam'), purity ('śhaucam'), steadfastness ('sthairyam'), and self-control ('ātma-vinigrahaḥ') are not merely ethical ideals but essential components of true knowledge and wisdom. Actively cultivate these qualities daily in your thoughts, words, and actions, as they prepare the mind and heart for deeper understanding."
14,22,"प्रकाशं च प्रवृत्तिं च मोहमेव च पाण्डव | न द्वेष्टि सम्प्रवृत्तानि न निवृत्तानि काङ्क्षति ||१४-२२||","prakāśhaṁ cha pravṛittiṁ cha moham eva cha pāṇḍava na dveṣhṭi sampravṛittāni na nivṛittāni kāṅkṣhati","The one who is undisturbed by illumination, activity, or delusion; who neither desires nor hates their presence.","Strive to become an impartial witness to the interplay of the three Gunas (modes of nature) within and around you: the clarity and illumination of Sattva ('prakāśham'), the activity and passion of Rajas ('pravṛittim'), and the delusion and inertia of Tamas ('moham'). Develop the inner stability ('na dveṣṭi... na kāṅkṣhati') to remain undisturbed whether these qualities are manifesting ('sampravṛittāni') or subsiding ('nivṛittāni'), neither craving the pleasant effects of Sattva nor hating the challenging aspects of Rajas and Tamas. This transcendence leads to steady wisdom."
15,7,"ममैवांशो जीवलोके जीवभूतः सनातनः | मनःषष्ठानीन्द्रियाणि प्रकृतिस्थानि कर्षति ||१५-७||","mamaivānśho jīva-loke jīva-bhūtaḥ sanātanaḥ manaḥ-ṣhaṣhṭhānīndriyāṇi prakṛiti-sthāni karṣhati","The eternal souls in this world are My fragmental parts, but they struggle with the six senses including the mind.","Recognize your fundamental nature as an eternal fragment ('sanātanaḥ mama eva anśaḥ') of the Divine, temporarily embodied as a living being ('jīva-bhūtaḥ') in this world ('jīva-loke'). Understand that the feeling of struggle arises from entanglement with the mind and five senses ('manaḥ-ṣhaṣhṭhāni indriyāṇi'), which are rooted in material nature ('prakṛiti-sthāni karṣhati'). This awareness is the starting point for self-realization – disentangling consciousness from the limited mind/senses to reclaim your true, divine identity."
16,1,"अभयं सत्त्वसंशुद्धिर्ज्ञानयोगव्यवस्थितिः | दानं दमश्च यज्ञश्च स्वाध्यायस्तप आर्जवम् ||१६-१||","abhayaṁ sattva-sanśhuddhir jñāna-yoga-vyavasthitiḥ dānaṁ damaśh cha yajñaśh cha svādhyāyas tapa ārjavam","Fearlessness, purity of heart, steadfastness in knowledge, charity, self-control, sacrifice, study of scriptures, austerity, simplicity.","Consciously cultivate the 'divine qualities' ('Daivi Sampat') that lead to liberation and well-being: fearlessness ('abhayam'), purity of inner being ('sattva-sanśuddhiḥ'), consistent engagement with knowledge ('jñāna-yoga-vyavasthitiḥ'), generosity ('dānam'), control of the senses ('damaḥ'), performing duties as sacrifice ('yajñaḥ'), study of wisdom texts ('svādhyāyaḥ'), self-discipline ('tapaḥ'), and straightforwardness ('ārjavam'). Nurture these as practical virtues for inner growth."
17,15,"अनुद्वेगकरं वाक्यं सत्यं प्रियहितं च यत् | स्वाध्यायाभ्यसनं चैव वाङ्मयं तप उच्यते ||१७-१५||","anudvega-karaṁ vākyaṁ satyaṁ priya-hitaṁ cha yat svādhyāyābhyasanaṁ chaiva vāṅ-mayaṁ tapa uchyate","Speech that causes no distress, is truthful, pleasant, and beneficial, along with regular recitation of scriptures—this is the austerity of speech.","Practice the 'austerity of speech' ('vāṅ-mayaṁ tapaḥ') by ensuring your communication ('vākyaṁ') is: non-agitating ('anudvega-karam'), truthful ('satyam'), pleasant ('priyam'), and beneficial ('hitam'). Avoid gossip, harshness, lies, or useless talk. Complement this with regular study/recitation of wisdom literature ('svādhyāyābhyasanam'). Mindful, constructive speech conserves energy, builds trust, and fosters positive environments."
18,58,"मच्चित्तः सर्वदुर्गाणि मत्प्रसादात्तरिष्यसि | अथ चेत्त्वमहङ्कारान्न श्रोष्यसि विनङ्क्ष्यसि ||१८-५८||","mach-chittaḥ sarva-durgāṇi mat-prasādāt tariṣhyasi atha chet tvam ahankārān na śhroṣhyasi vinaṅkṣhyasi","Fix your mind on Me, and by My grace you will overcome all obstacles. But if from ego you refuse to listen, you will perish.","When facing significant obstacles or difficult situations ('sarva-durgāṇi'), consciously fix your mind ('mach-chittaḥ') on your highest ideal, purpose, or the Divine. Trust that by aligning yourself with this higher wisdom and acting with humility, you will receive the insight and strength ('mat-prasādāt') to overcome them ('tariṣhyasi'). Conversely, recognize that acting solely from ego ('ahaṅkārāt'), refusing guidance or higher perspective ('na śroṣhyasi'), leads to errors, confusion, and potential failure ('vinaṅkṣhyasi')."
1,30,"वेपथुश्च शरीरे मे रोमहर्षश्च जायते | गाण्डीवं स्रंसते हस्तात्त्वक्चैव परिदह्यते ||१-३०||","vepathuśh cha śharīre me roma-harṣhaśh cha jāyate gāṇḍīvaṁ sraṁsate hastāt tvak chaiva paridahyate","My body is trembling, my hair is standing on end, my bow Gandiva is slipping from my hand, and my skin is burning all over.","(Verse 1.30 describes Arjuna's physical distress. The Application provided earlier fits 3.22: 'न मे पार्थास्ति कर्तव्यं...' - 'na me pārthāsti kartavyaṁ...') Look to the highest ideal (represented by Krishna's statement in 3.22) as a role model for selfless action. Even when seemingly having achieved everything or having no personal need driving the action ('na me... kartavyam asti', 'nānavāptam avāptavyam'), engaging purposefully in one's duties ('varta eva cha karmaṇi') sets a powerful example and contributes to the world's functioning ('loka-sangraha'). Let your work be performed as a contribution or an offering, detached from personal necessity or gain."
2,62,"ध्यायतो विषयान्पुंसः सङ्गस्तेषूपजायते | सङ्गात्सञ्जायते कामः कामात्क्रोधोऽभिजायते ||२-६२||","dhyāyato viṣhayān puṁsaḥ saṅgas teṣhūpajāyate saṅgāt sañjāyate kāmaḥ kāmāt krodho ’bhijāyate","While contemplating sense objects, attachment develops. From attachment arises desire, and from desire comes anger.","Understand the psychological chain reaction: Mentally dwelling ('dhyāyataḥ') on sense objects or experiences ('viṣhayān') creates attachment ('saṅgaḥ') to them. This attachment ('saṅgāt') inevitably breeds craving or desire ('kāmaḥ') to possess or repeat the experience. When this desire ('kāmāt') is thwarted or obstructed, it easily transforms into anger ('krodhaḥ'). Be mindful of where you habitually place your attention, as this is the root cause of emotional disturbance and entanglement. Guard your thoughts consciously."
4,7,"यदा यदा हि धर्मस्य ग्लानिर्भवति भारत | अभ्युत्थानमधर्मस्य तदात्मानं सृजाम्यहम् ||४-७||","yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata abhyutthānam adharmasya tadātmānaṁ sṛijāmyaham","Whenever righteousness declines and unrighteousness rises, O Bharat, I manifest Myself.","Recognize the cosmic principle that when ethical balance ('dharma') significantly declines ('glāniḥ') and injustice or unrighteousness ('adharma') prevails ('abhyutthānam'), forces naturally arise ('tadātmānaṁ sṛijamyaham' - I manifest Myself) to restore equilibrium. Be inspired by this to become an active participant in upholding ethical conduct and contributing positively, especially during challenging times, thereby aligning yourself with this restorative universal principle."
6,6,"बन्धुरात्मात्मनस्तस्य येनात्मैवात्मना जितः | अनात्मनस्तु शत्रुत्वे वर्तेतात्मैव शत्रुवत् ||६-६||","bandhur ātmātmanas tasya yenātmaivātmanā jitaḥ anātmanas tu śhatrutve vartetātmaiva śhatru-vat","For one who has conquered the mind, it is the best of friends. But for one who has failed, the mind becomes the greatest enemy.","Your relationship with your own mind depends entirely on your level of self-mastery. For one who has conquered the mind through discipline, mindfulness, and self-awareness ('yena ātmaiva ātmanā jitaḥ'), the mind acts as the most reliable friend ('bandhuḥ'), guiding towards constructive goals. But for one who has not achieved self-control ('anātmanaḥ'), the very same mind acts like an enemy ('śhatruvat'), working against one's well-being through negativity, distraction, doubt, and harmful impulses. Strive to master your mind."
7,3,"मनुष्याणां सहस्रेषु कश्चिद्यतति सिद्धये | यततामपि सिद्धानां कश्चिन्मां वेत्ति तत्त्वतः ||७-३||","manuṣhyāṇāṁ sahasreṣhu kaśhchid yatati siddhaye yatatām api siddhānāṁ kaśhchin māṁ vetti tattvataḥ","Among thousands of people, hardly one strives for perfection. Among those who strive, hardly one knows Me in truth.","Acknowledge the rarity of genuine, dedicated striving for spiritual perfection or self-realization ('siddhaye') among humanity ('manuṣhyāṇāṁ sahasreṣhu kaśhchit'), and the even greater rarity of attaining true, deep experiential wisdom ('kaśhchin māṁ vetti tattvataḥ') among those who strive. This understanding should inspire sincere and persistent effort in your own pursuits, humility regarding your progress, and deep appreciation for authentic knowledge and guidance when encountered. Value depth over superficiality."
8,5,"अन्तकाले च मामेव स्मरन्मुक्त्वा कलेवरम् | यः प्रयाति स मद्भावं याति नास्त्यत्र संशयः ||८-५||","anta-kāle cha mām eva smaran muktvā kalevaram yaḥ prayāti sa mad-bhāvaṁ yāti nāstyatra sanśhayaḥ","Whoever leaves the body remembering Me attains My nature. There is no doubt about this.","Understand the principle that one's predominant state of consciousness at the moment of death ('anta-kāle') strongly influences the subsequent state ('mad-bhāvam yāti'). Since this final thought ('smaran') is often the culmination of lifelong habitual thinking, cultivate a consistent focus on your highest values, purpose, or the Divine ('mām eva') throughout your life ('now'). What you practice consistently becomes your nature and determines your focus in critical moments, including the transition of death."
10,10,"तेषां सततयुक्तानां भजतां प्रीतिपूर्वकम् | ददामि बुद्धियोगं तं येन मामुपयान्ति ते ||१०-१०||","teṣhāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ taṁ yena mām upayānti te","To those steadfast in devotion, I give the yoga of understanding by which they come to Me.","To those who are constantly engaged ('satata-yuktānām') and serve or worship with sincere love and affection ('bhajatām prīti-pūrvakam'), the necessary divine understanding and discerning intelligence ('buddhi-yogam') is granted ('dadāmi'), enabling them to reach the ultimate goal ('yena mām upayānti te'). Approach your learning, work, or spiritual practice with consistent dedication and genuine heartfelt sincerity; this deep engagement attracts profound insights and guidance."
11,54,"भक्त्या त्वनन्यया शक्य अहमेवंविधोऽर्जुन | ज्ञातुं द्रष्टुं च तत्त्वेन प्रवेष्टुं च परन्तप ||११-५४||","bhaktyā tv ananyayā śhakya aham evaṁ-vidho ’rjuna jñātuṁ draṣhṭuṁ cha tattvena praveṣhṭuṁ cha parantapa","But only by undivided devotion can I be understood as I am, O Arjuna, seen directly, and entered into, O vanquisher of enemies.","(Verse 11.54 describes attaining the Cosmic Form through devotion. The Application provided earlier fits 11.55: 'मत्कर्मकृन्मत्परमो...' - 'mat-karma-kṛin mat-paramo...') Attain your highest potential or union with the Divine ('sa mām eti' - from 11.55) by integrating these key elements into your life: Perform your actions as service dedicated to a higher purpose ('mat-karma-kṛit'), make that purpose your supreme goal and refuge ('mat-paramah'), cultivate devotion and focused connection ('mad-bhaktaḥ'), remain free from selfish attachments ('saṅga-varjitaḥ'), and harbor no enmity or ill-will towards any being ('nirvairaḥ sarva-bhūteṣhu'). This holistic approach unites action, attitude, devotion, and ethics."
12,4,"ये त्वक्षरमनिर्देश्यमव्यक्तं पर्युपासते | सर्वत्रगमचिन्त्यं च कूटस्थमचलं ध्रुवम् ||१२-४||","ye tv akṣharam anirdeśhyam avyaktaṁ paryupāsate sarvatragam achintyaṁ cha kūṭastham achalaṁ dhruvam","(Verse 12.4 describes worship of the Impersonal Absolute.)","(The Application provided earlier fits 12.2: 'मय्यावेश्य मनो ये मां...' - 'mayy āveśhya mano ye māṁ...') Those individuals who fix their minds completely on their highest ideal or the Divine ('mayy āveśhya manaḥ'), engage constantly and steadfastly in practices that connect them to it ('nitya-yuktā upāsate'), and are endowed with supreme, unwavering faith ('śraddhayā parayopetāḥ'), are considered the most accomplished and perfectly integrated practitioners ('me yukta-tamāḥ matāḥ'). Wholehearted, faithful commitment yields the deepest connection and fulfillment."
13,28,"समं पश्यन्हि सर्वत्र समवस्थितमीश्वरम् | न हिनस्त्यात्मनात्मानं ततो याति परां गतिम् ||१३-२८||","samaṁ paśhyan hi sarvatra samavasthitam īśhvaram na hinasty ātmanātmānaṁ tato yāti parāṁ gatim","Because one who sees the Lord situated equally everywhere does not degrade himself by his mind. Thus he attains the supreme destination.","(Verse 13.28 explains the result of seeing equally. The Application provided earlier fits 13.27/28 concept: 'समं सर्वेषु भूतेषु...' - 'samaṁ sarveṣhu bhūteṣhu...') True perception ('saḥ paśhyati') lies in recognizing the one imperishable Supreme Reality ('parameśvaram avinaśhyantam') existing equally ('samam tiṣṭhantam') within all perishable beings and forms ('sarveṣhu bhūteṣhu vinaśhyatsu'). Cultivate this vision to look beyond temporary external differences (like appearance, status, species, opinions) and perceive the underlying unity and divinity in everyone and everything. This dissolves prejudice, fosters universal respect, and brings profound peace."
14,27,"ब्रह्मणो हि प्रतिष्ठाहममृतस्याव्ययस्य च | शाश्वतस्य च धर्मस्य सुखस्यैकान्तिकस्य च ||१४-२७||","brahmaṇo hi pratiṣhṭhāham amṛitasyāvyayasya cha śhāśhvatasya cha dharmasya sukhasyaikāntikasya cha","I am the foundation of Brahman, the immortal and imperishable, of eternal dharma, and of unending divine joy.","Recognize the personal aspect of the Divine ('Aham'/Krishna) as the ultimate foundation or abode ('pratiṣṭhā') supporting everything eternal and real: the impersonal Absolute Reality ('Brahmaṇaḥ'), immortality ('amṛitasya') and imperishability ('avyayasya'), eternal righteousness ('śāśvatasya dharmasya'), and ultimate, absolute, unwavering bliss ('sukhasya aikāntikasya'). Anchor your life, values, and quest for happiness in this eternal, unchanging source, rather than seeking lasting fulfillment in temporary worldly objects or experiences."
15,19,"यो मामेवमसम्मूढो जानाति पुरुषोत्तमम् | स सर्वविद्भजति मां सर्वभावेन भारत ||१५-१९||","yo mām evam asammūḍho jānāti puruṣhottamam sa sarva-vid bhajati māṁ sarva-bhāvena bhārata","One who knows Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without delusion, attains all knowledge and worships Me wholeheartedly.","One who, free from delusion ('asammūḍhaḥ'), truly understands ('jānāti') the Divine ('Mām') as the Supreme Person ('Puruṣhottamam'), gains the essence of all knowledge ('saḥ sarva-vit' - knows the All). This profound understanding naturally leads to engaging in loving devotion and service with their entire being ('bhajati māṁ sarva-bhāvena'). True wisdom integrates intellect and heart, culminating in wholehearted, loving engagement with the Supreme Reality."
16,24,"तस्माच्छास्त्रं प्रमाणं ते कार्याकार्यव्यवस्थितौ | ज्ञात्वा शास्त्रविधानोक्तं कर्म कर्तुमिहार्हसि ||१६-२४||","tasmāch chāstraṁ pramāṇaṁ te kāryākārya-vyavasthitau jñātvā śhāstra-vidhānoktaṁ karma kartum ihārhasi","Therefore, let scripture be your authority in determining what should and should not be done. Understand scriptural injunctions and act accordingly.","In matters of discerning right conduct from wrong conduct ('kāryākārya-vyavasthitau'), let the wisdom enshrined in authentic scriptures and ethical teachings ('śhāstram') serve as your standard or authority ('pramāṇam'). First, seek to understand ('jñātvā') the principles and injunctions prescribed ('śhāstra-vidhānoktam'), and then endeavor to act ('karma kartum ihārhasi') in accordance with that understanding. When facing complex moral dilemmas, consult timeless wisdom rather than relying solely on fluctuating personal opinions or societal pressures."
17,28,"अश्रद्धया हुतं दत्तं तपस्तप्तं कृतं च यत् | असदित्युच्यते पार्थ न च तत्प्रेत्य नो इह ||१७-२८||","aśhraddhayā hutaṁ dattaṁ tapas taptaṁ kṛitaṁ cha yat asad ity uchyate pārtha na cha tat pretya no iha","Anything done as sacrifice, charity, or penance without faith is called 'asat' (unreal). It is useless here and hereafter.","Understand that any act of sacrifice ('hutam'), charity ('dattam'), austerity ('tapas taptam'), or any other action ('kṛitam cha yat') performed without sincere faith, conviction, and reverence ('aśraddhayā') is termed 'asat' – unreal, ineffective, or counterproductive. Such actions yield no true benefit, either in this life ('na iha') or the next ('na pretya'). The inner attitude and sincerity ('śraddhā') behind an action are paramount; perform duties and practices with genuine belief and commitment."
18,46,"यतः प्रवृत्तिर्भूतानां येन सर्वमिदं ततम् | स्वकर्मणा तमभ्यर्च्य सिद्धिं विन्दति मानवः ||१८-४६||","yataḥ pravṛittir bhūtānāṁ yena sarvam idaṁ tatam sva-karmaṇā tam abhyarchya siddhiṁ vindati mānavaḥ","By worshiping the Supreme, from whom all beings originate and by whom all this is pervaded, humans can attain perfection through their duties.","Attain perfection or fulfillment ('siddhiṁ vindati mānavaḥ') by performing your own natural work and duties ('svakarmaṇā') as an act of worship ('tam abhyarchya') directed towards the Supreme Source from whom all beings emanate ('yataḥ pravṛittiḥ bhūtānām') and by whom the entire universe is pervaded ('yena sarvam idaṁ tatam'). See your unique work, performed with dedication and excellence, as your specific and effective way of honoring and connecting with the divine intelligence underlying all existence."
18,65,"मन्मना भव मद्भक्तो मद्याजी मां नमस्कुरु | मामेवैष्यसि सत्यं ते प्रतिजाने प्रियोऽसि मे ||१८-६५||","man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru mām evaiṣhyasi satyaṁ te pratijāne priyo ’si me","Always think of Me, become My devotee, worship Me and offer your homage unto Me. Thus you will come to Me without fail. I promise you this because you are My very dear friend.","(Slight variation in wording, but same core message as the previously listed 18.65). Embrace the path of devotion as the most direct means to attain union with the Divine: Constantly fix your mind on your highest ideal ('man-manā bhava'), become Its dedicated devotee ('mad-bhaktaḥ'), perform all actions as worship offered to It ('mad-yājī'), and offer obeisance with reverence and humility ('māṁ namaskuru'). By thus uniting your entire being – mind, heart, actions – with the Supreme as your ultimate refuge, you will surely attain It ('mām evaiṣhyasi'). This is the essence of complete surrender."
2,3,"क्लैब्यं मा स्म गमः पार्थ नैतत्त्वय्युपपद्यते | क्षुद्रं हृदयदौर्बल्यं त्यक्त्वोत्तिष्ठ परन्तप ||२-३||","klaibyaṁ mā sma gamaḥ pārtha naitat tvayy upapadyate kṣhudraṁ hṛidaya-daurbalyaṁ tyaktvottiṣhṭha parantapa","Arjuna, it does not befit you to yield to this unmanliness. Give up such petty weakness of heart and arise, O vanquisher of enemies.","Do not succumb to paralyzing weakness, impotence, or faint-heartedness ('klaibyam,' 'kṣhudraṁ hṛidaya-daurbalyam') when facing daunting challenges, ethical dilemmas, or necessary duties (like exams, presentations, difficult conversations). Recognize that such debilitating negativity does not align with your inherent strength and potential ('naitat tvayy upapadyate'). Consciously reject this despondency ('tyaktvā'), summon your inner courage and resolve, and stand up ('uttiṣṭha') to meet the situation, O capable individual ('Parantapa')."
2,49,"दूरेण ह्यवरं कर्म बुद्धियोगाद्धनञ्जय | बुद्धौ शरणमन्विच्छ कृपणाः फलहेतवः ||२-४९||","dūreṇa hy avaraṁ karma buddhi-yogād dhanañjaya buddhau śharaṇam anvichchha kṛipaṇāḥ phala-hetavaḥ","Action is far inferior to the yoga of wisdom, O Arjuna. Seek refuge in wisdom—pitiful are those motivated by results.","Understand that mechanical action ('karma') performed without guiding wisdom is vastly inferior ('dūreṇa hy avaram') to actions performed with enlightened intelligence and understanding ('buddhi-yogāt'). Therefore, consciously seek refuge ('śharaṇam anvichchha') in this higher intelligence or wisdom ('buddhau'). Those who are solely motivated by the fruits or results of their actions ('phala-hetavaḥ') are considered 'kṛipāṇāḥ' (miserly, pitiful) because they miss the broader perspective, inner freedom, and true purpose that wisdom provides. Prioritize understanding."
3,8,"नियतं कुरु कर्म त्वं कर्म ज्यायो ह्यकर्मणः | शरीरयात्रापि च ते न प्रसिद्ध्येदकर्मणः ||३-८||","niyataṁ kuru karma tvaṁ karma jyāyo hy akarmaṇaḥ śharīra-yātrāpi cha te na prasiddhyed akarmaṇaḥ","You should perform your prescribed duties, for action is better than inaction. Even maintaining your body would be impossible without action.","Consistently perform your prescribed or necessary duties ('niyataṁ kuru karma') because engaging in required action ('karma') is inherently superior ('jyāyaḥ') to falling into inertia or inaction ('akarmaṇaḥ'). Recognize that even the basic maintenance of your physical existence ('śarīra-yātrā api') depends on continuous action. Overcome procrastination and apathy; engage actively, responsibly, and purposefully with your life and responsibilities."
3,9,"यज्ञार्थात्कर्मणोऽन्यत्र लोकोऽयं कर्मबन्धनः | तदर्थं कर्म कौन्तेय मुक्तसङ्गः समाचर ||३-९||","yajñārthāt karmaṇo ’nyatra loko ’yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ tad-arthaṁ karma kaunteya mukta-saṅgaḥ samāchara","Work done as sacrifice for Vishnu frees one from karmic bondage. Therefore, O Arjuna, perform your duties as offerings, free from attachment.","Understand that actions ('karma') create binding reactions and consequences ('karma-bandhanaḥ') when performed with selfish motives ('anyatra' - other than for Yajna). However, when work is performed as a sacrifice ('yajñārthāt') – offered selflessly for a higher purpose, the common good, or the Divine – it leads to liberation. Therefore, perform your duties ('tad-arthaṁ karma') with this spirit of selfless offering, free from personal attachment ('mukta-saṅgaḥ'). This transforms work from a potential source of entanglement into a path of freedom and spiritual growth."
4,18,"कर्मण्यकर्म यः पश्येदकर्मणि च कर्म यः | स बुद्धिमान्मनुष्येषु स युक्तः कृत्स्नकर्मकृत् ||४-१८||","karmaṇyakarma yaḥ paśhyed akarmaṇi cha karma yaḥ sa buddhimān manuṣhyeṣhu sa yuktaḥ kṛitsna-karma-kṛit","One who sees inaction in action and action in inaction is wise among humans. Such a person is a yogi who has accomplished all work.","The truly wise person ('saḥ buddhimān') perceives the element of stillness, non-doership, or the uninvolved Self ('akarma') even amidst dynamic activity ('karmaṇi'). They also recognize the subtle action, potential, or mental engagement ('karma') present even in apparent physical inaction ('akarmaṇi'). Cultivating this insight allows one to act effectively in the world without being bound by ego or results, remaining inwardly detached and peaceful ('saḥ yuktaḥ'). This wisdom integrates action and contemplation."
4,33,"श्रेयान्द्रव्यमयाद्यज्ञाज्ज्ञानयज्ञः परन्तप | सर्वं कर्माखिलं पार्थ ज्ञाने परिसमाप्यते ||४-३३||","śhreyān dravya-mayād yajñāj jñāna-yajñaḥ parantapa sarvaṁ karmākhilaṁ pārtha jñāne parisamāpyate","The sacrifice of knowledge is superior to material sacrifices, O Arjuna, for all actions culminate in wisdom.","Value the pursuit, cultivation, and sharing of knowledge and wisdom ('jñāna-yajñaḥ') as a superior form of sacrifice or offering ('śhreyān') compared to sacrifices performed merely with material objects or wealth ('dravya-mayāt yajñāt'). Understand that the ultimate purpose and fulfillment ('parisamāpyate') of all dedicated actions ('sarvam karma akhilam') lies in the attainment of wisdom ('jñāne'). Prioritize learning, understanding, and spiritual insight."
4,38,"न हि ज्ञानेन सदृशं पवित्रमिह विद्यते | तत्स्वयं योगसंसिद्धः कालेनात्मनि विन्दति ||४-३८||","na hi jñānena sadṛiśhaṁ pavitram iha vidyate tat svayaṁ yoga-sansiddhaḥ kālenātmani vindati","There is nothing as purifying as knowledge in this world. Those perfected in yoga find it in due course within themselves.","Recognize that in this world ('iha'), there exists no purifier as potent and sublime ('pavitram sadṛiśham') as true knowledge or wisdom ('jñānena'). This profound wisdom is not merely acquired intellectually but is realized directly within oneself ('ātmani') in the course of time ('kālena') by one who becomes perfected through the dedicated and consistent practice of yoga ('tat svayam yoga-sansiddhaḥ vindati'). Persist in your practice with faith; clarity purifies the mind."
5,2,"श्रीभगवानुवाच | संन्यासः कर्मयोगश्च निःश्रेयसकरावुभौ | तयोस्तु कर्मसंन्यासात्कर्मयोगो विशिष्यते ||५-२||","śhrī bhagavān uvācha sannyāsaḥ karma-yogaśh cha niḥśhreyasa-karāv ubhau tayos tu karma-sannyāsāt karma-yogo viśhiṣhyate","Both renunciation of action and karma yoga lead to liberation. But of the two, karma yoga is superior to mere renunciation.","While both the path of formal renunciation of actions ('sannyāsaḥ') and the path of performing actions selflessly ('karma-yogaḥ') can lead to the highest good or liberation ('niḥśreyasa-karau ubhau'), engaging skillfully in action with detachment (Karma Yoga) is considered more effective and practical ('viśhiṣhyate') for most people than simply abstaining from action ('karma-sannyāsāt'). Actively participate in life and fulfill your duties, but cultivate inner detachment, rather than seeking liberation solely through withdrawal."
6,1,"श्रीभगवानुवाच | अनाश्रितः कर्मफलं कार्यं कर्म करोति यः | स संन्यासी च योगी च न निरग्निर्न चाक्रियः ||६-१||","śhrī bhagavān uvācha anāśhritaḥ karma-phalaṁ kāryaṁ karma karoti yaḥ sa sannyāsī cha yogī cha na niragnir na chākriyaḥ","One who performs duty without dependence on results is a true renunciant and yogi—not one who abandons fire or action.","Understand that a true renunciant ('Sannyāsī') and a true Yogi is not defined by external appearances, such as abandoning traditional duties (like maintaining the sacred fire - 'na niragniḥ') or merely ceasing all activity ('na chākriyaḥ'). Rather, the true Yogi is one who performs their obligatory duty ('kāryaṁ karma karoti yaḥ') without being dependent on or attached to the fruits or results of that action ('anāśritaḥ karma-phalam'). Integrate mindful action with inner detachment in your daily life to embody this principle."
6,35,"असंशयं महाबाहो मनो दुर्निग्रहं चलम् | अभ्यासेन तु कौन्तेय वैराग्येण च गृह्यते ||६-३५||","asanśhayaṁ mahā-bāho mano durnigrahaṁ chalam abhyāsena tu kaunteya vairāgyeṇa cha gṛihyate","The mind is restless and difficult to restrain, O mighty-armed Arjuna, but through practice and detachment it can be controlled.","Acknowledge without doubt ('asaṁśayam') that the mind ('manaḥ') is indeed restless ('chalam') and difficult to control ('durnigraham'). However, do not despair, as it *can* be brought under control ('gṛihyate') through two primary methods: consistent, patient, and diligent practice ('abhyāsena') – such as meditation, mindfulness, or focused effort – and the cultivation of detachment or dispassion ('vairāgyeṇa') – reducing craving for sense pleasures and aversion to difficulties. These two are the keys to mental mastery."
7,16,"चतुर्विधा भजन्ते मां जनाः सुकृतिनोऽर्जुन | आर्तो जिज्ञासुरर्थार्थी ज्ञानी च भरतर्षभ ||७-१६||","chatur-vidhā bhajante māṁ janāḥ sukṛitino ’rjuna ārto jijñāsur arthārthī jñānī cha bharatarṣhabha","Four types of virtuous people worship Me: the distressed, the seeker of knowledge, the seeker of wealth, and the wise, O Arjuna.","Recognize that people are drawn to spiritual life, self-improvement, or seeking help from a higher power ('bhajante mām') for various valid reasons ('chatur-vidhāḥ'): those suffering or in distress ('ārtaḥ'), those seeking knowledge and understanding ('jijñāsuḥ'), those seeking legitimate worldly needs, security or prosperity ('arthārthī'), and those who possess innate wisdom and seek union ('jñānī'). All these types of sincere seekers ('sukṛitinaḥ') are considered virtuous; honor the validity of different motivations on the path."
7,18,"उदाराः सर्व एवैते ज्ञानी त्वात्मैव मे मतम् | आस्थितः स हि युक्तात्मा मामेवानुत्तमां गतिम् ||७-१८||","udārāḥ sarva evaite jñānī tv ātmaiva me matam āsthitaḥ sa hi yuktātmā mām evānuttamāṁ gatim","All these seekers are noble, but I consider the wise to be My very Self. They are steadfast, united with Me as their supreme goal.","While all four types of seekers mentioned previously are noble and praiseworthy ('udārāḥ sarve eva ete'), the wise individual ('jñānī'), who seeks the Divine out of pure knowledge and selfless love, is considered exceptionally dear, like the Divine's own Self ('tu ātmā eva me matam'). This is because the wise person is steadily established ('āsthitaḥ'), fully integrated ('yukta-ātmā'), and solely focused on the Supreme as the ultimate, unsurpassed goal ('mām eva anuttamāṁ gatim'). Strive to elevate your aspirations towards this state of wisdom and selfless devotion."
8,7,"तस्मात्सर्वेषु कालेषु मामनुस्मर युध्य च | मय्यर्पितमनोबुद्धिर्मामेवैष्यस्यसंशयः ||८-७||","tasmāt sarveṣhu kāleṣhu mām anusmara yudhya cha mayy arpita-mano-buddhir mām evaiṣhyasy asanśhayaḥ","Therefore, remember Me at all times and fight (perform duties).

With your mind and intellect dedicated and surrendered ('mayi arpita-mano-buddhiḥ') to this higher purpose, you will undoubtedly attain the supreme goal ('mām eva eṣhyasi asaṁśayaḥ'). Integrate spiritual awareness seamlessly with active engagement in the world."
9,14,"सततं कीर्तयन्तो मां यतन्तश्च दृढव्रताः | नमस्यन्तश्च मां भक्त्या नित्ययुक्ता उपासते ||९-१४||","satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ yatantaśh cha dṛiḍha-vratāḥ namasyantaśh cha māṁ bhaktyā nitya-yuktā upāsate","My devotees constantly chant My glories, striving with determination, bowing before Me with devotion, always united with Me.","Engage in practices that foster continuous connection ('nitya-yuktāḥ') and devotion ('upāsate'): regularly remembering, speaking of, or chanting the glories of your ideal ('satatam kīrtayantaḥ mām'), making determined and disciplined efforts ('yatantaḥ cha dṛḍha-vratāḥ') in your practice and duties, approaching with humility, reverence, and loving devotion ('namasyantaḥ cha mām bhaktyā'). Consistency, determination, and heartfelt sincerity are key elements of a thriving devotional or spiritual practice."
9,27,"यत्करोषि यदश्नासि यज्जुहोषि ददासि यत् | यत्तपस्यसि कौन्तेय तत्कुरुष्व मदर्पणम् ||९-२७||","yat karoṣhi yad aśhnāsi yaj juhoṣhi dadāsi yat yat tapasyasi kaunteya tat kuruṣhva mad-arpaṇam","Whatever you do, eat, offer, give away, or perform as austerity, O Arjuna, do it as an offering to Me.","Cultivate an attitude of consecration in all aspects of life. Whatever action you perform ('yat karoṣhi'), whatever you eat or consume ('yad aśnāsi'), whatever ritual or offering you make ('yaj juhoṣhi'), whatever you give away in charity ('dadāsi yat'), whatever discipline or austerity you undertake ('yat tapasyasi') – perform that action consciously as an offering ('tat kuruṣhva mad-arpaṇam') to the Divine or your highest ideal. This practice sanctifies everyday activities, fosters mindfulness, and cultivates detachment from results."
10,4,"बुद्धिर्ज्ञानमसंमोहः क्षमा सत्यं दमः शमः | सुखं दुःखं भवोऽभावो भयं चाभयमेव च ||१०-४||","buddhir jñānam asammohaḥ kṣhamā satyaṁ damaḥ śhamaḥ sukhaṁ duḥkhaṁ bhavo ’bhāvo bhayaṁ chābhayam eva cha","Wisdom, knowledge, clarity, forgiveness, truthfulness, self-control, peacefulness, happiness, distress, birth, death, fear, and fearlessness...","Recognize that the diverse range of qualities and states of being experienced by living entities – such as intelligence ('buddhiḥ'), knowledge ('jñānam'), freedom from delusion ('asammohaḥ'), forgiveness ('kṣhamā'), truthfulness ('satyam'), control of the senses ('damaḥ'), calmness of mind ('śamaḥ'), as well as the dualistic experiences like happiness/distress ('sukham duḥkham'), birth/death ('bhavaḥ abhāvaḥ'), fear/fearlessness ('bhayam cha abhayam') – all ultimately originate from the one Divine Source (as stated in 10.5). This fosters acceptance and inspires cultivation of divine qualities."

Everything emanates, functions, and evolves ('sarvam pravartate') from this single source ('mattaḥ'). The wise ('budhāḥ') who grasp this fundamental truth ('iti matvā') engage in worship, service, and devotion ('bhajante mām') with deep conviction and heartfelt feeling ('bhāva-samanvitāḥ'). See the divine underpinning in all fields of knowledge and existence, learning with reverence."
11,33,"तस्मात्त्वमुत्तिष्ठ यशो लभस्व जित्वा शत्रून्भुङ्क्ष्व राज्यं समृद्धम् | मयैवैते निहताः पूर्वमेव निमित्तमात्रं भव सव्यसाचिन् ||११-३३||","tasmāt tvam uttiṣhṭha yaśho labhasva jitvā śhatrūn bhuṅkṣhva rājyaṁ samṛiddham mayaivaite nihatāḥ pūrvam eva nimitta-mātraṁ bhava savya-sāchin","Therefore arise and attain glory!

Act with courage to achieve success and honor ('yaśaḥ labhasva'), overcome your inner and outer obstacles ('jitvā śatrūn'), and fulfill your potential ('bhuṅkṣva rājyaṁ samṛiddham'). Understand that when your actions align with the larger divine will or righteous purpose, the positive outcome is already potentially secured ('maya eva ete nihatāḥ pūrvam eva'). Your role is to act as a willing, conscious, and skillful instrument ('nimitta-mātram bhava') for that purpose to manifest."
12,8,"मय्येव मन आधत्स्व मयि बुद्धिं निवेशय | निवसिष्यसि मय्येव अत ऊर्ध्वं न संशयः ||१२-८||","mayy eva mana ādhatsva mayi buddhiṁ niveśhaya nivasiṣhyasi mayy eva ata ūrdhvaṁ na sanśhayaḥ","Fix your mind on Me alone, immerse your intellect in Me. Thereafter, you shall dwell in Me forever—of this there is no doubt.","Concentrate your mind ('manaḥ') exclusively and steadfastly on your chosen highest ideal or the Divine ('Mayi eva ādhatsva'). Deliberately immerse and absorb your intellect ('buddhim') completely in understanding, contemplating, and connecting with It ('mayi niveśhaya'). By achieving this unified focus of both mind and intellect, you will undoubtedly come to dwell consciously and permanently in that Supreme Reality ('nivasiṣhyasi mayy eva ataḥ ūrdhvam'), free from further divergence or doubt ('na saṁśayaḥ'). This demands dedicated mental discipline."
12,12,"श्रेयो हि ज्ञानमभ्यासाज्ज्ञानाद्ध्यानं विशिष्यते | ध्यानात्कर्मफलत्यागस्त्यागाच्छान्तिरनन्तरम् ||१२-१२||","śhreyo hi jñānam abhyāsāj jñānād dhyānaṁ viśhiṣhyate dhyānāt karma-phala-tyāgas tyāgāch chhāntir anantaram","Knowledge is better than practice, meditation is better than knowledge, renunciation of results is better than meditation—peace immediately follows renunciation.","Understand the hierarchy and progression in spiritual practice for attaining peace: While mechanical practice ('abhyāsāt') is beneficial, informed knowledge ('jñānam') is superior ('śreyaḥ'). Better ('viśiṣhyate') than theoretical knowledge is meditation ('dhyānam') or deep contemplation. Superior even to meditation is the renunciation of the fruits of actions ('dhyānāt karma-phala-tyāgaḥ'). From such complete detachment from outcomes ('tyāgāt'), profound peace ('śāntiḥ') follows swiftly and directly ('anantaram'). Strive towards non-attachment as the most direct path to inner peace."

Cultivating sattvic qualities through pure thoughts, ethical actions, and mindful living naturally leads to increased wisdom and perceptual clarity."
14,11,"सर्वद्वारेषु देहेऽस्मिन्प्रकाश उपजायते | ज्ञानं यदा तदा विद्याद्विवृद्धं सत्त्वमित्युत ||१४-११||","sarva-dvāreṣhu dehe ’smin prakāśha upajāyate jñānaṁ yadā tadā vidyād vivṛiddhaṁ sattvam ity uta","When illumination radiates through all the senses, know that sattva predominates.","When clarity, brightness, and the light of knowledge ('prakāśaḥ', 'jñānam') seem to radiate ('upajāyate') through all the gateways of the senses ('sarva-dvāreṣu') in this body ('dehe asmin'), understand ('vidyāt') this experience as a clear indication that the quality of purity, harmony, and goodness ('sattvam') has become predominant ('vivṛddham'). Purity of lifestyle, thoughts, and intentions directly enhances perceptual clarity, understanding, and inner peace."

Consciously cultivate these qualities to transcend worldly limitations and find lasting peace."
16,21,"त्रिविधं नरकस्येदं द्वारं नाशनमात्मनः | कामः क्रोधस्तथा लोभस्तस्मादेतत्त्रयं त्यजेत् ||१६-२१||","tri-vidhaṁ narakasyedaṁ dvāraṁ nāśhanam ātmanaḥ kāmaḥ krodhas tathā lobhas tasmād etat trayaṁ tyajet","Lust, anger, and greed are the three gates to hell leading to the soul's degradation. Therefore, one should abandon all three.","Recognize clearly the three primary gateways ('tri-vidham dvāram') leading to suffering ('narakasya') and the degradation of the self ('nāśhanam ātmanaḥ'): intense selfish desire or lust ('kāmaḥ'), anger ('krodhaḥ'), and greed ('lobhaḥ'). Understand their destructive power in your life, relationships, and inner peace. Therefore, make a conscious and determined effort to abandon ('tyajet') these three negative forces through self-awareness, discipline, cultivating contentment, forgiveness, and generosity."
17,16,"मनःप्रसादः सौम्यत्वं मौनमात्मविनिग्रहः | भावसंशुद्धिरित्येतत्तपो मानसमुच्यते ||१७-१६||","manaḥ-prasādaḥ saumyatvaṁ maunam ātma-vinigrahaḥ bhāva-sanśhuddhir ity etat tapo mānasam uchyate","Serenity of mind, gentleness, silence, self-restraint, and purity of purpose—these constitute austerity of the mind.","Practice the true austerity or discipline of the mind ('tapaḥ mānasam') by cultivating: serenity, clarity and cheerfulness of mind ('manaḥ-prasādaḥ'), gentleness in thought and attitude ('saumyatvam'), meaningful inner silence or control over mental chatter ('maunam'), restraint and mastery over the mind ('ātma-vinigrahaḥ'), and purity of intention, motive, and thought ('bhāva-sanśuddhiḥ'). This inner discipline is a powerful form of self-purification that leads to lasting mental peace and clarity."
18,5,"यज्ञदानतपःकर्म न त्याज्यं कार्यमेव तत् | यज्ञो दानं तपश्चैव पावनानि मनीषिणाम् ||१८-५||","yajña-dāna-tapaḥ-karma na tyājyaṁ kāryam eva tat yajño dānaṁ tapaśh chaiva pāvanāni manīṣhiṇām","Acts of sacrifice, charity, and austerity should not be abandoned but performed. These purify even the wise.","Do not abandon the essential practices of sacrifice ('yajña' - selfless service, contribution, rituals for common good), charity ('dāna' - generosity, giving according to capacity), and austerity ('tapaḥ' - discipline, self-control, enduring hardship for a higher purpose). These actions ('karma') must certainly be performed ('na tyājyam, kāryam eva tat'), as they serve as powerful purifiers ('pāvanāni'), elevating the consciousness even of those who are already wise ('manīṣiṇām'). Regularly engage in these three pillars of righteous action."
18,45,"स्वे स्वे कर्मण्यभिरतः संसिद्धिं लभते नरः | स्वकर्मनिरतः सिद्धिं यथा विन्दति तच्छृणु ||१८-४५||","sve sve karmaṇy abhirataḥ sansiddhiṁ labhate naraḥ sva-karma-nirataḥ siddhiṁ yathā vindati tac chhṛiṇu","By devotion to one's own natural work, every person can attain perfection. Hear how one achieves such perfection.","Each person ('naraḥ') can attain perfection or fulfillment ('sansiddhim labhate') by being wholeheartedly engaged and devoted ('abhirataḥ') in their own natural work or duty ('sve sve karmani'), which is aligned with their innate psychophysical nature (Svadharma). Find fulfillment and achieve your highest potential by focusing on excelling in the work and responsibilities that naturally suit your talents and temperament, rather than pursuing roles or duties that are contrary to your inherent disposition, which often leads to stress and inefficiency."
